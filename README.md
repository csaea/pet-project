# pet-project
my pet project

To run your code:

1. Compile each class: 
javac src/com/mypetproject/Main.java
javac src/com/mypetproject/Pet.java

2. Run the program via Main
java src.com.mypetproject.Main

Better practices: 
1. Compile all java files at once with a wildcard (*) and put them in their own directory named `out`:
`javac -d out src/com/mypetproject/*.java`






















package com.mypetproject;
