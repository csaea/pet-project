# pet-project
My Pet Project - a simple coding example covering the basics of Java Object-Oriented-Programming. 

## How to execute the code
In terminal, make sure you navigate to the `src` directory. (Use `ls` to list all files, and `cd` to change directory until you're in `src`).

1. Compile all classes in a package:
javac com/mypetproject/*.java

2. Run the program via Main
javac com/mypetproject/*.java

Better practice: 
Compile all java files and put them in their own directory named `out`:
javac -d out src/com/mypetproject/*.java






















package com.mypetproject;
