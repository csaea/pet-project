My Pet Project - In-class live coding example covering the basics of Java. 

To run your code:

1. Compile all classes in a package:
`javac src/com/mypetproject/*.java` 

2. Run the program via Main
`java src.com.mypetproject.Main`

Better practice: 
Compile all java files and put them in their own directory named `out`:
`javac -d out src/com/mypetproject/*.java`






















package com.mypetproject;
